# bankApp

 In this application I deepened my knowledge in javascript, the application is based on array methods.
 
 The first time you put the data from the bank account that is predefined, click on the arrow and it shows you the data from your account (which are predefined from the code) .
 If you want to transfer money to someone, it must already be registered and not be an amount that exceeds your total.
 If you want to borrow money, you must follow certain predefined rules for your amount.
 If you want to log out, you must enter the correct account name and pin.
 When you press the sort button it sorts your trading data ascending, we used the sort () method.

To as many achievements as possible ! :)
